“Laza '' is a Hebrew word which means “God has helped” and ''tech” is a short word for technology. This name shows the goal of the system which is to aid students in their online learning and provide a helping online community to answer their queries and acquire more knowledge.  The platform intends to offer a plagiarism checker inside the Lazatech website application to ensure the credibility and uniqueness of the information posted in it. And most importantly, a user-friendly and engaged tech community aims to help each other on their college voyage. The platform's initial functions are blog, forum, polls, and event creation. These functions are under development, and the developers may add other functions that they see fit for the system, which can help the users to have a straightforward approach in learning computer programming tools and codes.      
     An awarding system based on the assigned token value every post from a user or the social media management will be regulated, and when someone answers it correct and helped that post author significantly, he or she will receive that assigned token value. These processes will be used to encourage students to help their fellow students inside the platform. The initial plan for this component is the person who significantly help a post author and that author agreed to give that person the reward would receive a $LZT token from the XRP ledger which they can be used in their future projects to help them on their expenses or trade it on the XRPL trading platform. The committee would also pick some posts that needs to be answered urgently and assign a specific token value in it. Once answered the token value assigned will be sent to the person who answered the post correctly and significantly help the author. The token was created using the XUMM application. Coil web monetization integration would also be used in the Lazatech platform for the acquisition of funds for the awards. Coil provides an alternative to traditional paid advertising for online monetization. As consumers consume content, Coil employs the interledger protocol (ILP) to broadcast micropayments. The payment channels of the XRPL are a suitable method for settling these micropayments quickly and cheaply (Jacobs, 2019).
     To explore other website's functions in further detail, it includes forums, blogs, polls, and events. An internet forum is a place where people may discuss a range of topics. Its members can initiate discussions and read and respond to other users' posts. A forum can cover various issues and help its participants develop a sense of virtual community (Sharief, 2020). He also stated that forums, which are frequently referred to as bulletin boards or discussion groups, differ from blogs in that the latter is typically published by a user or web administrator and typically only allows for responses from other users regarding blog content. All website members are often permitted to post and create new discussions. Additionally, users can create blogs to discuss their thoughts on the technologies used in the information technology area or any other technological ideas. They can also build polls that allow other users to vote on whatever item or piece of software they prefer to use. Users can also establish events that serve as reminders for upcoming meetings or webinar courses addressing current IT trends. By and large, a new member must register before joining a group or asking a question. This user must adhere to specific online norms known as netiquette, including respect for other users and avoiding lousy language. Each message typically includes an avatar, portrait, or graphic submitted by the member next to the username. Additionally, users can ask, answer, and share ideas with other platform users.

Objectives of the Study
     The main objective of this project is to develop a platform that will enable students who are in need of assistance in working with the tools and software for online classes, projects, and activities.
Specific Objectives 
         The study aims to achieve the following:
Create an online environment whose function is to share information about computer technology concepts and software tools which include:
 1.1. Software Tools:
1.1.1 Python Programming
     1.1.2 Git and GitHub
     1.1.3 PHP and MySQL Web Development
     1.1.4 Java Programming
      1.1.5 Documentation Creation
     1.1.6 Website Development
     1.1.7 Data Analysis in Python
1.2 Online Modules:
     1.2.1 Forum Management
     1.2.2 Blog Management
     1.2.3 Polls Management
     1.2.4 Event Management
Provide a platform to check plagiarism on a content to avoid redundancy of information.
Provides every user a portfolio page where all people they help will be listed. This includes the information about the content or answer they provided and the value of token they have received.
Create an online module that will provide a reward system using crypto currency that will provide rewards to the users based on the agreed token value assigned to a post.
